## State Minimum Requirements (Reference)

Every state has different minimum insurance requirements. Elite Insurance Partners ensures compliance with all state laws.

**Most Common State Minimums:**
- Bodily Injury: $25,000 / $50,000
- Property Damage: $25,000
- Uninsured Motorist: Varies by state

**Our Recommendation:** State minimums often insufficient for serious accidents. We recommend at least:
- Bodily Injury: $100,000 / $300,000

**Average Cost of Serious Accident:** $50,000-$200,000+

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How quickly can I get coverage?**
A: Elite Insurance can bind coverage immediately over the phone or online. You'll have proof of insurance within minutes via email and mobile app.

**Q: What if I need an SR-22?**
A: We file SR-22 certificates in all states that require them. There's a one-time $25 filing fee, and your premium will be recalculated based on your driving record.

**Q: Do you cover rental cars?**
A: Your policy can extend to rental cars if you have comprehensive and collision coverage. Rental car coverage is automatically included at no extra charge for damage to the rental vehicle.

**Q: What happens if I let my policy lapse?**
A: There's a 10-day grace period. After that, coverage terminates and you'll need to reapply. Gaps in coverage can result in higher future premiums. We offer payment plans to avoid lapses.

**Q: Can I get insurance if I have a bad driving record?**
A: Yes. While your premium will be higher, we work with high-risk drivers. After demonstrating safe driving for 3 years, you'll qualify for standard rates.

**Q: How does accident forgiveness work?**
A: After 3 years claim-free (1 year for Premium coverage), your first at-fault accident won't raise your rates. This benefit resets after 3 more claim-free years.

**Q: What's not covered by auto insurance?**
A: Intentional damage, normal wear and tear, mechanical breakdown (unless you have MBI), racing, using vehicle for commercial purposes without commercial coverage, driving under the influence.

**Q: How are teenagers rated?**
A: Teen drivers (16-19) are rated based on the primary vehicle they drive. Good student discounts and defensive driving courses can significantly reduce premiums. We also offer usage-based insurance to reward safe driving.

**Q: Can I exclude my spouse from my policy?**
A: In most states, yes, but only if they have their own policy or don't drive. If they live in your household and have a license, they typically must be listed or excluded with a signed form.

**Q: What if the other driver doesn't have insurance?**
A: Your uninsured motorist coverage protects you. We handle recovery efforts against the at-fault party directly, so you don't have to worry about it.
