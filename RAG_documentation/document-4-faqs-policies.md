- $500 to $2,500: Save 30-40% on collision/comprehensive

**Example:**
- Current premium: $150/month with $500 deductible

# General FAQs

## Coverage Questions

### Q: What does "full coverage" mean?

**A:** "Full coverage" is not an industry term, but typically refers to:
- **Liability Coverage:** Covers damage you cause to others
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Covers non-collision damage to your vehicle (theft, weather, vandalism)
- **Collision Coverage:** Covers collision damage to your vehicle

This combination protects you for most scenarios. However, "full coverage" doesn't mean everything is covered - there are still exclusions and limits.

**What's NOT included in "full coverage":**
- Mechanical breakdowns
- Normal wear and tear
- Intentional damage
- Racing or commercial use
- Custom equipment (unless specifically added)

---

### Q: Do I really need more than state minimum insurance?

**A:** State minimums are often inadequate. Here's why:

**State Minimum Problems:**
- Minimums set decades ago, haven't kept up with costs
- Average serious accident costs $50,000-$200,000+
- You're personally liable for amounts exceeding your coverage
- They can garnish wages, seize assets, put liens on your home

**Example:**
- State minimum: $25,000 per person
- Serious accident: Other driver has $75,000 in medical bills
- You're personally liable for: $50,000

**Our Recommendation:**
- Minimum: 100/300/100
- Better: 250/500/250
- Consider umbrella policy for additional protection

---

### Q: What's the difference between comprehensive and collision?

**A:** Both cover damage to your vehicle, but for different reasons:

**Collision Coverage:**
- Covers: Accidents with other vehicles or objects
- Examples:

**Exceptions:**
1. **Excluded Driver:** If they're excluded on your policy, NO COVERAGE
2. **Unlisted Household Member:** May not be covered
3. **Stolen Vehicle:** Their insurance may be primary
4. **Commercial Use:** May not be covered under personal policy

**Best Practice:**
- Only lend car to licensed, responsible drivers
- Verify they're not excluded
- Check your coverage before lending
- Consider: If they wreck it, you pay deductible and rates increase

**Proof of Insurance:**
- ID cards available immediately via email/app
- Physical cards mailed within 2 business days

**Important:**
- Must make first payment to bind
- Can select future effective date
- Gap in coverage affects future rates

---

### Q: How long do accidents and tickets stay on my record?

**A:** Varies by type and state:

**Accidents:**
- At-fault accidents: 3-5 years
- Not-at-fault accidents: 0-3 years (varies by state)
- Serious accidents: Up to 7 years

**Moving Violations:**
- Speeding tickets: 3 years
- Reckless driving: 5 years
- DUI/DWI: 7-10 years
- License suspension: 5-10 years

**After Time Period:**
- Removed from insurance record
- No longer affects rates
- May still be on driving record

**Clean Record Faster:**
- Defensive driving course may remove minor ticket
- Expungement (court process, if eligible)
- Accident forgiveness prevents rate increase

---

### Q: What is accident forgiveness and how does it work?

**A:** Accident forgiveness prevents your rates from increasing after your first at-fault accident:

**Standard Policy:**
- First at-fault accident forgiven after 3 years claim-free
- Rates won't increase from that accident
- Resets after 3 more years claim-free

**Premium Policy:**
- First accident forgiven after 1 year claim-free
- Faster forgiveness
- Additional protection

**How It Works:**
1. You're in an at-fault accident
2. We pay the claim as normal
3. At renewal, your rates DON'T increase
4. You keep your safe driver discount
5. After 3 more claim-free years, you earn forgiveness again

**Important:**
- Only covers first accident in forgiveness period
- Doesn't apply to DUI or serious violations
- Doesn't erase accident from record (still reported)
- Second accident in period WILL increase rates

**Example:**
- Without forgiveness: $150/month → $195/month after accident (+30%)
- With forgiveness: $150/month → $150/month (no change)
- **Saves: $540/year**

---

### Q: Can I have two auto insurance policies?

**A:** Technically yes, but not recommended:

**Problems with Dual Coverage:**
- Pays double premium unnecessarily
- Doesn't increase coverage (each policy covers independently)
- Claim complications (which pays first?)
- May be considered insurance fraud if hiding information

**When It Might Happen:**
- Switching insurers with overlap (OK for short term)
- Vehicle on two household policies (not necessary)
- Personal and commercial policy for same vehicle (may be needed)

**Each Insurer's Response:**
- Typically only pays their share proportionally
- May investigate for fraud
- Could cancel both policies

**Proper Solution:**
- One policy per vehicle
- List all household drivers
- Bundle multiple vehicles on one policy for discounts

---

### Q: What happens if I miss a payment?

**A:** Depends on timing and your payment history:

**Grace Period (Days 1-10):**
- Coverage continues
- No penalty
- No late fee
- Make payment ASAP

**After Grace Period (Day 11+):**
- Policy cancels
- No coverage
- Late fee charged ($10-25)
- Reinstatement fee may apply
- Must pay in full to reinstate

**Reinstatement (Within 30 Days):**
- Call customer service immediately
- Pay all past-due amounts plus fees
- Coverage reinstated (no gap if within 30 days)
- May require payment plan going forward

**After 30 Days:**
- Must reapply as new customer
- Higher rates due to coverage lapse
- Underwriting review required
- May be declined

**To Avoid:**
- Set up auto-pay (never miss payment + 5% discount)
- Set calendar reminders
- Call before due date if having trouble (payment plans available)

- Dealership
- Certified network shop

**Certified Network Shops:**
- Pre-negotiated rates (may save money)
- Guaranteed repairs (we stand behind workmanship)
- Streamlined process
- Direct billing (you only pay deductible)

---

### Q: What if the repair costs more than the estimate?

**A:** Common situation, handled through supplemental claims:

**Why It Happens:**
- Hidden damage discovered during teardown
- Parts more expensive than estimated
- Additional labor required

**Process:**
1. Shop discovers additional damage
2. Shop contacts your adjuster
3. Adjuster reviews supplemental damage
4. Additional repairs approved
5. You don't pay additional deductible

**Your Deductible:**
- Only pay once per claim
- Not per estimate
- Even if multiple supplements

**Timeline:**
- May extend repair time
- Shop and adjuster coordinate
- You're kept informed

**If Shop Tries to Charge More:**
- Contact your adjuster immediately
- Review original estimate and supplement
- Adjuster negotiates with shop
- You only pay your deductible (for covered items)

---

### Q: What is "actual cash value" and how is it calculated?

**A:** Actual Cash Value (ACV) is what your car is worth today:

**Formula:**
ACV = Replacement Cost - Depreciation

**Factors:**
- Year, make, model
- Mileage
- Condition before accident
- Local market values
- Recent sales of comparable vehicles
- Optional equipment and features
- Prior damage

**Not Included:**
- What you paid originally
- What you owe on loan
- Emotional value
- Your replacement cost

**Example:**
- 2020 Honda Accord, 35,000 miles
- Excellent condition
- Purchased new for $28,000
- Current ACV: $22,000 (depreciation)
- Your loan balance: $24,000
- Insurance pays: $22,000
- You owe: $2,000 (why gap insurance helps)

**Depreciation Factors:**
- Age: ~20% first year, 10-15% per year after
- Mileage: Below/above average affects value
- Condition: Excellent vs. poor makes difference
- Market: Supply and demand in your area
- Modifications: May increase or decrease value

**Valuation Tools Used:**
- CCC ONE
- Mitchell
- NADA
- Kelly Blue Book
- Local market analysis

### Q: Can I keep my car if it's totaled?

**A:** Yes, you can retain the salvage:

**Process:**
1. Insurance declares total loss
2. You express interest in keeping vehicle
3. Salvage value deducted from settlement
4. You receive: ACV - Deductible - Salvage Value
5. You keep the vehicle and salvage title

**Example:**
- ACV: $10,000
- Your deductible: $500
- Salvage value: $2,000
- You receive: $7,500
- You keep the damaged vehicle

**Considerations:**

**Pros:**
- Keep car for parts
- Repair yourself if capable
- Sentimental value preserved

**Cons:**
- Salvage title (difficult to insure or sell)
- May not be safe to drive
- Limited insurance options
- Reduced resale value
- May not be repairable to safe standards

**State Requirements:**
- Salvage title issued
- May require inspection to re-register
- Some states prohibit driving salvage vehicles

### Q: What happens if I pay off my car loan?

**A:** You have more flexibility but should be careful:

**What Changes:**
- Lender no longer requires comprehensive/collision
- You can adjust coverage as you see fit
- May lower deductibles or remove coverage

**Should You Keep Coverage?**

**Yes, If:**
- Vehicle worth more than $2,000-$3,000
- You can't afford to replace if totaled
- Live in high-theft or weather-prone area
- Want protection from uninsured drivers

**Consider Removing If:**
- Vehicle worth less than $2,000
- Repair costs likely to exceed value
- Premiums high relative to value
- Have emergency fund to replace vehicle

**Smart Approach:**
- Calculate: Annual premium × 2 years = $X
- Compare to vehicle value
- If premium exceeds 25-30% of vehicle value, consider dropping

**Example:**
- Vehicle value: $3,000
- Comprehensive/collision premium: $600/year
- Two-year cost: $1,200 (40% of value)
- Recommendation: Consider liability only

**Alternative:**
- Keep comprehensive (theft, weather)
- Remove collision
- Saves money while maintaining some protection

- $60-120 per year extra

**Why Charged:**
