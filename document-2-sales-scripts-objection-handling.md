# Elite Insurance Partners - Sales Scripts & Objection Handling Guide

At Elite Insurance Partners, we believe insurance sales is about protection, not pressure. Our approach is consultative: we listen first, understand the customer's situation, and recommend coverage that genuinely protects what matters most to them.

**Core Principles:**
1. **Empathy First** - Understand their situation before pitching
2. **Education Over Persuasion** - Informed customers make better decisions
3. **Long-term Relationships** - We're not here for one sale, but a lifetime partnership
4. **Honesty Always** - If we're not the best fit, we say so
5. **Value Over Price** - Focus on protection value, not just premium cost

---

## Qualifying Questions Framework

### Phase 1: Current Situation (Build Rapport)

**Vehicle Information:**
- "What vehicle are you looking to insure?" [Year, make, model]
- "Is this a vehicle you already own, or are you planning to purchase it?"
- "How do you primarily use this vehicle - daily commute, weekend drives, work-related?"
- "About how many miles do you drive per year?"
- "Where is the vehicle kept overnight - garage, driveway, street parking?"

**Current Coverage Status:**
- "Do you currently have insurance on this vehicle or another vehicle?"
- "Are you looking to switch from another company, or is this new coverage?"
- "What made you start looking for insurance / consider switching?" [Pain point discovery]
- "When does your current policy expire?" or "When do you need coverage to start?"

### Phase 2: Risk Profile (Understand Needs)

**Driver Information:**
- "Who will be the primary driver of this vehicle?"
- "Are there any other household members who will drive the vehicle?"
- "How long have you been driving?" [If under 25 or new driver]
- "Have you had any accidents or tickets in the past 3-5 years?"

**Financial Situation (Tactfully):**
- "Is the vehicle financed, leased, or owned outright?" [Determines coverage requirements]
- "What's most important to you in an insurance policy - the most comprehensive coverage, affordability, or a balance of both?"
- "Do you have a budget range you're working within?"

**Coverage Preferences:**
- "Have you thought about what level of coverage you need?"
- "Do you have any specific concerns you want to make sure are covered - maybe theft, weather damage, or being hit by someone without insurance?"

## Sales Presentation Framework

### Step 1: Recap Their Needs

**Sarah:** "Okay [Name], let me make sure I understand what you're looking for. You have a [year, make, model] that you use primarily for [use case], you're looking for coverage that [key need], and you want to make sure you're getting good value. Did I get that right?"

### Step 2: Recommend Coverage Tier

**For Budget-Conscious with Older Vehicle:**
**Sarah:** "Based on what you've told me, I'd recommend our Basic Coverage package. Since your vehicle is paid off and has higher mileage, you can save money by going with liability-only coverage that meets state requirements. You'll be protected if you cause an accident, but we won't be covering damage to your vehicle. This typically runs about $60-100 per month. Does that sound like it could work for you?"

**For Standard Need (Financed Vehicle):**
**Sarah:** "Since your vehicle is financed, your lender will require comprehensive and collision coverage. I'd recommend our Standard Coverage package. This covers you for accidents, theft, weather damage - basically anything that could happen to your vehicle. It includes $500 deductible, rental car coverage while yours is being repaired, and roadside assistance. For your situation, we're looking at around $120-150 per month. How does that align with what you were expecting?"

**For High-Value Vehicle or Maximum Protection:**
**Sarah:** "For a newer vehicle like yours, I'd strongly recommend our Premium Coverage. This gives you the highest liability limits, a lower $250 deductible, and includes features like new car replacement if it's totaled within the first two years. You'll also get accident forgiveness, so your first accident won't raise your rates. Think of it as complete peace of mind. For your [vehicle], that would be about $180-220 per month. Given the value of your vehicle, does that feel reasonable?"

### Step 3: Apply Discounts

**Sarah:** "Now let me see what discounts you qualify for, because this is where we can really bring that price down."

[Review qualifying factors]

**Sarah:** "Great news - you qualify for:
- Multi-policy discount if you bundle with home/renters: 20% savings
- Safe driver discount with no accidents: 25% savings
- Auto-pay and paperless: 5% savings
- Our DriveWise app for safe driving: potential 15% savings

That brings your monthly payment down to approximately $[reduced amount]. That's a savings of $[amount] per month, or $[amount] per year."

### Step 4: Address Coverage Gaps

**Sarah:** "One thing I want to make sure you're aware of - I noticed [potential gap]. For example, if someone hits you and doesn't have insurance, or doesn't have enough insurance, you could be stuck with medical bills and repair costs. We have uninsured motorist coverage that protects against this for just $[amount] more per month. Given that [statistic about uninsured drivers in their state], this is something I recommend to everyone. Would you like me to include that?"

### Step 5: Trial Close

**Sarah:** "So to summarize, you'd be getting [coverage tier] with [key benefits], and with all your discounts, you're looking at $[amount] per month. How does that sound to you?"

---

## Objection Handling Scripts

### OBJECTION: "That's Too Expensive"

**Approach:** Show value, adjust coverage, create urgency

**Response 1 - Value Reframe:**
**Sarah:** "I completely understand budget is a big factor - it is for everyone. Can I ask what you were hoping to pay?"

[Customer provides number]

**Sarah:** "Okay, that's helpful. Let me ask you this - when you think about what you're protecting - your $[vehicle value] vehicle, your financial security if someone sues you after an accident, your family's safety - does $[price difference] per month, which is about $[daily amount] per day, feel like reasonable protection? That's less than a cup of coffee a day for complete peace of mind."

**Response 2 - Adjust Coverage:**
**Sarah:** "I hear you. Let's see if we can adjust some things to fit your budget. One option is to increase your deductible from $500 to $1,000. You'd save about $30-40 per month, though you'd pay more out of pocket if you have a claim. Another option is to remove rental car coverage for about $12 less per month. What feels more important to you?"

**Response 3 - Payment Plans:**
**Sarah:** "I understand the monthly amount might feel like a lot. Many of our customers find it easier to pay in full for the 6-month policy and save 5%, or we can break it into smaller payments. We also have a quarterly payment option. Would any of those work better for your situation?"

**Response 4 - Comparison to Current:**
**Sarah:** "I get it. Out of curiosity, what are you paying now with your current insurance?"

[If they're paying similar or more:]
**Sarah:** "So we're actually right in line with what you're already paying, but with Elite you'd be getting [additional benefits]. And with our [specific discount], we'd actually save you $[amount]."

[If they're paying less:]
**Sarah:** "I appreciate you sharing that. Can I ask what coverage you currently have?"

[Often reveals they have minimal coverage]

**Sarah:** "That makes sense why it's less - you're comparing our comprehensive protection to basic liability. Let me show you what our Basic Coverage would cost, which is similar to what you have now, and then you can decide if the additional protection is worth the difference."

---

### OBJECTION: "I Need to Think About It"

**Approach:** Uncover real concern, create urgency, offer next steps

**Response 1 - Discovery:**
**Sarah:** "Absolutely, this is an important decision and I want you to feel confident. Can I ask what specifically you'd like to think about? Is it the price, the coverage options, or something else? I'm happy to clarify anything."

[Listen for real objection and address it]

**Response 2 - Gentle Urgency:**
**Sarah:** "I completely understand. Just so you're aware, this quote is good for 30 days, but your current coverage expires on [date], right? We typically recommend getting new coverage in place at least a few days before your policy expires to avoid any gaps. Even a one-day gap can significantly increase your rates with future insurers. When were you planning to make a decision?"

**Response 3 - Soft Close:**
**Sarah:** "That's totally fine. How about this - I can send you all the quote details via email so you have everything in writing. If you have any questions as you're reviewing it, you can call me directly or reply to the email. Does that work for you?"

**Response 4 - Alternative:**
**Sarah:** "No problem at all. Would it be helpful if I scheduled a time to follow up with you in a few days? That way you have time to think, and I can answer any questions that come up. What day works better for you - [day 1] or [day 2]?"

---

### OBJECTION: "I'm Getting Quotes from Other Companies"

**Approach:** Affirm their process, differentiate, secure follow-up

**Response 1 - Encourage Comparison:**
**Sarah:** "That's smart - you should definitely shop around to make sure you're getting the best coverage and value. When you're comparing quotes, can I suggest a few things to look at beyond just the price?"

[Customer agrees]

**Sarah:** "Make sure you're comparing the same coverage limits and deductibles - a cheaper price might mean less protection. Also ask about:
- Claims response time - we guarantee an adjuster within 2 hours
- Discount programs - we have safe driving app discounts up to 30%
- Customer service availability - we're 24/7, not just business hours
- Accident forgiveness - ours kicks in after just 3 years

Those things aren't always obvious in a quote but make a huge difference when you need your insurance most."

**Response 2 - Competitive Positioning:**
**Sarah:** "I'm glad you're comparing - that's the right approach. Can I ask which companies you're getting quotes from?"

[Customer shares competitors]

**Sarah:** "[Competitor] is a solid company. The main difference with Elite is [specific advantage - e.g., 'our local agents,' 'accident forgiveness,' 'better app']. A lot of our customers actually switched from [competitor] because [specific reason]. But definitely compare and see what works best for you."

**Response 3 - Be Their Advocate:**
**Sarah:** "Great! When you're reviewing quotes, watch out for companies that start with a super low rate but increase significantly at renewal - that's a common tactic. Also, if a quote seems too good to be true, double-check that it includes comprehensive and collision, not just liability. I've seen people get surprised by that. Can I send you our quote in writing so you have it for comparison?"

---

### OBJECTION: "Your Competitor Quoted Me $[Amount Lower]"

**Approach:** Don't immediately drop price, find gaps, show value

**Response 1 - Coverage Comparison:**
**Sarah:** "That's helpful to know. Before we talk about matching prices, I want to make sure we're comparing apples to apples. Do you happen to have that quote handy? I'd love to see what coverage they're offering."

[If they do:]
**Sarah:** "Okay, I see they quoted you [coverage details]. Our quote includes [additional protections theirs doesn't]. That's why there's a difference in price. You'd be getting [specific value]. Is that worth $[price difference] per month to you?"

[If they don't:]
**Sarah:** "No worries. The most common differences are liability limits, deductible amounts, and whether rental cars and roadside assistance are included. Could you tell me what their liability limits were?"

**Response 2 - Question Quality:**
**Sarah:** "That's definitely a lower price. Out of curiosity, who was the quote from?"

[If it's a budget/low-quality insurer:]
**Sarah:** "Ah, okay. [Company] does tend to have lower rates, but I want you to be aware of a few things. They're known for [specific issue - slow claims, poor customer service, high rate increases]. When you have an accident - and I hope you never do - the difference in service becomes really important. Are you comfortable with potential trade-offs for the lower price?"

**Response 3 - Match If Reasonable:**
**Sarah:** "You know what, let me see what I can do. If they're offering [similar coverage], I may be able to adjust some things. Give me just a moment."

[Review for legitimate adjustments]

**Sarah:** "Okay, I can get you to $[amount] by [adjustment - higher deductible, remove certain coverage]. That puts us right in range with their quote, and you'd still get Elite's superior claims service and 24/7 support. Would that work for you?"

---

### OBJECTION: "I Don't Need That Much Coverage"

**Approach:** Educate on risk, use scenarios, give control

**Response 1 - Risk Education:**
**Sarah:** "I hear you, and a lot of people feel the same way - until they need it. Can I share a quick example of why we recommend this level?"

[Customer agrees]

**Sarah:** "Let's say you're in an accident and the other person has $50,000 in medical bills. If you only have the state minimum of $25,000 coverage, you'd be personally responsible for the other $25,000. They could sue you, garnish your wages, even put a lien on your home. The difference in cost between minimum coverage and the protection we're recommending is about $[amount] per month - way less than the risk you'd be taking on."

**Response 2 - Personal Situation:**
**Sarah:** "That's fair. Can I ask - do you own your home or have significant assets like savings or retirement accounts?"

[If yes:]
**Sarah:** "That's exactly why higher liability limits are important. If you cause a serious accident and the claim exceeds your coverage, the person suing you can go after your home, your bank accounts, your retirement savings. For $[amount] more per month, you protect everything you've worked for. Is it worth that peace of mind?"

[If no:]
**Sarah:** "I understand. The good news is you have less to protect from lawsuits. We could definitely go with lower limits. Just know that if something serious happens, there's more personal risk. Let me show you what that would cost and you can decide."

**Response 3 - Give Them Control:**
**Sarah:** "You're absolutely in control of your coverage - I'm just here to make sure you understand the options and risks. If you want to go with [lower coverage], we can do that. I just want to make sure you know what you'd be giving up. Here's what that would look like: [quote with lower coverage]. Which feels right for you?"

---

### OBJECTION: "I Don't Drive Much, Why Do I Need Full Coverage?"

**Approach:** Explain non-driving risks, offer usage-based alternative

**Response 1 - Comprehensive Coverage Education:**
**Sarah:** "That's a great point, and low mileage actually qualifies you for a discount with us! But here's the thing - comprehensive coverage isn't just about accidents you cause while driving. It covers things like:
- Your car getting stolen from your driveway
- Hail or storm damage while it's parked
- A tree falling on it
- Vandalism
- Hitting a deer

None of those have anything to do with how much you drive, but they could cost thousands to repair. Does that make sense?"

**Response 2 - Usage-Based Discount:**
**Sarah:** "Since you don't drive much, you're actually a perfect candidate for our low-mileage discount - that can save you 10-15% right there. Plus, we have a safe driving app that gives you even bigger discounts based on your actual driving habits. Many of our low-mileage customers save 25-30% total. Would you be interested in that?"

**Response 3 - Alternative Suggestion:**
**Sarah:** "I hear you. If budget is tight because you're not using the vehicle much, have you considered whether you even need to keep the car? Some customers find that occasional Uber or rental cars are cheaper than insurance and maintenance on a car they barely use. Just a thought - but if you do keep it, I'd hate for one incident to cost you thousands when insurance would have covered it."

---

### OBJECTION: "My Friend/Family Member Works for [Competitor]"

**Approach:** Respect relationship, plant seeds, offer objective comparison

**Response 1 - Respect the Relationship:**
**Sarah:** "That's great that you have someone you trust helping you! Personal relationships are important. I'm definitely not here to step on any toes or come between you and your [friend/family member]. Can I ask - have they already provided you with a quote?"

[If yes:]
**Sarah:** "Perfect. Would it be okay if I still provided you with a quote from Elite? That way you can compare and make the most informed decision - and you might even find something in our quote that you can ask them to match. At the very least, you'll know you got the best deal. Sound fair?"

[If no:]
**Sarah:** "Makes sense. Well, if you decide to shop around before committing, I'm happy to provide a quote for comparison. Sometimes it's nice to have options, even when you're working with someone you know. No pressure either way."

**Response 2 - Polite Exit with Future Open:**
**Sarah:** "I completely understand loyalty to family. I'd do the same thing. If things ever change or you want a second opinion down the road, feel free to reach out. I'm here to help. Thanks for your time today, [Name]."

---

### OBJECTION: "I've Been With [Company] for Years, Why Should I Switch?"

**Approach:** Praise loyalty, question if it's reciprocated, offer fresh perspective

**Response 1 - Loyalty Question:**
**Sarah:** "That's wonderful that you've been loyal to them - loyalty should be rewarded. Can I ask, have they been taking care of you? Have your rates stayed competitive, or have they gone up significantly over the years?"

[Customer usually admits rates increased]

**Sarah:** "That's really common, actually. A lot of companies count on customer loyalty and raise rates gradually, knowing most people won't shop around. The ironic thing is, they often give better rates to new customers than to longtime loyal customers like you. It might be worth seeing if you're getting the loyalty you've given them."

**Response 2 - Fresh Look:**
**Sarah:** "There's definitely something to be said for staying with a company you trust. At the same time, the insurance market has changed a lot in recent years - new discounts, better technology, improved customer service. It's worth taking a fresh look every few years to make sure you're getting the best value. Even if you decide to stay with [company], at least you'll know you made an informed choice. Can I put together a quote for comparison?"

**Response 3 - Pain Point Discovery:**
**Sarah:** "That's great you've been with them so long. Can I ask - has everything been smooth with them? Claims handled well, easy to reach customer service, no surprise rate increases?"

[If customer expresses any frustration:]
**Sarah:** "I hear that frustration. Sometimes when you've been with a company a long time, they take you for granted. At Elite, we actually give increasing loyalty discounts - 5% after year one, 10% after year two, 15% after year three. We believe loyalty should be rewarded, not penalized. Want to see what we could offer?"

---

### OBJECTION: "I Just Want Liability, I Don't Need Anything Else"

**Approach:** Respect choice, educate on risks, show minimal upgrade option

**Response 1 - Qualify the Reason:**
**Sarah:** "That's totally fine, we can do liability-only coverage. Just so I understand, is that because your vehicle is older and not worth much, or is it more about the monthly cost?"

[If older vehicle:]
**Sarah:** "That makes perfect sense. If the car's not worth much, it doesn't make sense to pay for comprehensive and collision. Let's focus on making sure you have enough liability coverage to protect YOU in case of an accident. How does that sound?"

[If cost-driven:]
**Sarah:** "I understand. Budget is important. Just so you're aware, liability-only means if your car gets stolen, damaged, or totaled, you'd have to pay to replace it yourself. Could you afford to replace the vehicle if something happened to it?"

[If yes:]
**Sarah:** "Okay, then liability might work for you. Let me get you a quote on that."

[If no/uncertain:]
**Sarah:** "That's my concern. Without comprehensive and collision, one bad incident could leave you without a car and without money to replace it. Let me show you what the cost difference would be - it might be less than you think."

**Response 2 - Minimal Upgrade:**
**Sarah:** "I respect that decision. Let me show you something though - what if we did liability plus comprehensive-only coverage? That would protect you from theft, vandalism, weather damage, and animal hits for just $[amount] more per month. You'd skip collision coverage to keep it affordable, but you'd at least have protection from the things outside your control. Would that be worth considering?"

---

### OBJECTION: "I Had a Bad Experience with Insurance Before"

**Approach:** Empathize deeply, let them vent, differentiate your service

**Response 1 - Deep Listening:**
**Sarah:** "I'm really sorry to hear that. Nobody should have a bad insurance experience, especially when you need help most. Can you tell me what happened? I want to make sure we don't repeat that mistake."

[Customer explains - LET THEM FULLY VENT]

**Sarah:** "That sounds incredibly frustrating, and I understand why you'd be hesitant to trust another company. What you experienced - [specific issue] - is exactly what we've built Elite to avoid. Here's how we're different..."

**Response 2 - Specific Differentiation:**
**Sarah:** "I hear you. Claims are where the rubber meets the road with insurance, right? Let me tell you exactly how our process works, because I think you'll see the difference:

- You report a claim 24/7, instantly through our app or by phone
- Within 2 hours - not days, but 2 hours - a dedicated adjuster is assigned to you
- They contact you directly with their cell phone number
- You're not bounced between departments or kept in the dark
- Average claims are settled in 3-7 days

We also have a customer satisfaction guarantee - if you're not happy with your claims experience, we have a dedicated advocacy team that steps in. Does that sound more like what you'd expect from an insurance company?"

**Response 3 - Trust Building:**
**Sarah:** "I can't change what happened with [previous company], but I can promise you that we'll treat you with respect and transparency. Here's what I suggest - let me provide you with a quote and the names and numbers of a couple current customers who've filed claims with us. You can call them directly and ask about their experience. If you're not comfortable after that, no hard feelings. Fair enough?"

---

## Cross-Selling Opportunities

### Home/Renters Bundle

**Trigger:** Customer owns home or mentions renting

**Script:**
**Sarah:** "By the way, I noticed you [own your home / are renting]. Do you have insurance on that?"

[If no:]
**Sarah:** "Okay, we should definitely get you covered there too. The great news is, if you bundle your auto and [home/renters] insurance with us, you'll save 20-25% on both policies. That's usually $200-400 per year in savings. Want me to put together a quick quote while we're on the phone?"

[If yes with another company:]
**Sarah:** "Got it. You know, by bundling your auto and [home/renters] with Elite, you'd save 20-25% on both policies. A lot of customers find the savings are significant enough to switch both over. Would you be open to me running a quick comparison quote?"

---

### Teen Driver Addition

**Trigger:** Customer mentions children approaching driving age

**Script:**
**Sarah:** "I heard you mention you have a [age]-year-old. Are they starting to drive soon?"

[If yes:]
**Sarah:** "Exciting and nerve-wracking at the same time, right? Here's some good news - we have specific programs for teen drivers that can save you money. Our safe driving app gives them feedback on their driving and can reduce your premium by 15-20%. We also have a good student discount if they maintain a B average. When they get their license, give me a call and we'll get them added with all the available discounts. Sound good?"

---

### Umbrella Policy

**Trigger:** Customer has high income, owns home, has significant assets

**Script:**
**Sarah:** "One thing I want to mention - you mentioned you [own a home / have a good job / have significant assets]. Have you considered umbrella insurance?"

[Customer asks what it is:]

**Sarah:** "It's extra liability coverage that sits on top of your auto and home insurance. Let's say you cause a serious accident and get sued for $1 million, but your auto policy only covers $300,000. You'd be personally liable for the other $700,000 - they could come after your house, savings, retirement accounts. An umbrella policy covers that gap. For $1 million in extra protection, it's usually only $150-300 per year. For someone in your situation, it's really important to have. Want me to include that in your quote?"

---

## Closing Techniques

### Trial Close (Throughout Conversation)

**After presenting coverage:**
"How does that sound so far?"
"Does that make sense for what you're looking for?"
"Is this the kind of coverage you had in mind?"

---

### Assumptive Close

**When customer seems ready:**
**Sarah:** "Great! Let me get this policy started for you. I'll need your VIN number and we can have you covered in the next few minutes. Do you have that handy?"

---

### Alternative Close

**When customer is deciding:**
**Sarah:** "So which works better for you - the Standard Coverage with the $500 deductible, or would you prefer Premium with the $250 deductible and accident forgiveness?"

---

### Urgency Close

**When customer is delaying:**
**Sarah:** "I totally understand you want to think about it. Just so you know, your current coverage expires in [X days], and this quote is only good for 30 days. Also, if there's any gap in coverage - even one day - it can significantly impact your rates with any insurance company going forward. How about I schedule you for a follow-up call in 2 days? That way you have time to think, but we make sure you're not at risk of a coverage gap. Does [date/time] work?"

---

### Summary Close

**When customer needs reassurance:**
**Sarah:** "Let me just make sure we're on the same page. You'd be getting [coverage tier] that covers [key benefits], you're saving $[amount] with [specific discounts], and your total monthly payment is $[amount]. You'll have 24/7 claims support, our mobile app for instant ID cards, and coverage starts immediately. If something doesn't feel right in the first 30 days, you can cancel for a full refund. Does that all sound good to you?"
